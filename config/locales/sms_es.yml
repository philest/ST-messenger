    poems:
      bird:
        - "The smallest of the baby birds\nWas too afraid to fly.\nHis sisters flew, his brothers too,\nBut baby bird just cried."
        - "His mother said, \"Oh baby bird!\"\n\"You'll do it if you try!\"\n\"I promise you can do it son,\"\n\"A mother never lies!\""
        - "And baby bird trusted his mom,\nSo once he dried his eyes,\nHe bravely leapt out from the nest\nAnd flew into the sky."
      whale:
        - "Eli went to wash the dishes,\nWhen from the sink out swam some fishes!\nOut came a turtle, crab, and whale,\nAnd then a boat with purple sails!"
        - "The fish wanted him to jump in,\nBut Eli was too scared to swim!\nThen Eli’s Mom showed his young son\nHow kitchen swimming can be fun!"
        - "With help from Mom, Eli felt brave.\nHe dove into a faucet wave!\nThen Eli smiled with clothes all wet,\nAnd swam with Mom and his new pets."
      seed:
        - "I found a giant magic seed,\nIts polka dots were pink and green.\nIt said to me, \"Oh pretty please,\"\n\"Will you please plant and water me?\""
        - "And since the seed was so polite\nI planted him that very night.\nWith dirt I packed him snug and tight,\nIt rained until the morning light."
        - "When I woke up that magic seed\nHad grown into a big tall tree!\nIts branches had green jelly beans\nAnd bright pink cotton candy leaves!"
        - "100 hungry birds all flew\nTo eat as much as they could chew.\nI asked the tree, \"May I eat too?\"\nIt said, \"Of course! The rest’s for you!\""
      chores:
        - "I love my chores, it's true, it's true!\nI love the things I get to do!"
        - "I get to help take out the trash\nAnd watch the garbage truck go smash!"
        - "I get to help out with the sink\nAnd use the soap to clean (not drink!)"
        - "But my most favorite chore of all\nIs when I help to paint the walls!"
      ants:
        - "If I leave out my birthday cake\nThe ants will think it’s theirs to take.\nTheir home is outside, far away,\nBut they start marching night and day."
        - "They walk together in a line,\nThey walk and walk through rain or shine.\nThey walk through dirt, through mud, through roads,\nThey walk until they find my home."
        - "One million ants slip past my door\nTo eat the cake that’s on the floor!\nAnd slowly the cake disappears,\nWhile little ants give tiny cheers."
        - "The hungry ants have had their fill,\nThey head out through the windowsill.\nThe ants go quick, they do not wait,\nAnd all they leave is a clean plate!"
