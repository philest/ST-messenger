      hero:

      bird:
        - "Baby Bird\n\nThe smallest of the baby birds\nWas too afraid to fly.\nHis sisters flew, his brothers too,\nBut baby bird just cried. (1)"

      whale:
        - "Eli's Fish\n\nEli went to wash the dishes,\nWhen from the sink out swam some fishes!\nOut came a turtle, crab, and whale,\nAnd then a boat with purple sails!(1)"
        - "The fish wanted him to jump in,\nBut Eli was too scared to swim!\nThen Eli’s Mom showed her son\nHow kitchen swimming can be fun! (2)"
        - "With help from Mom, Eli felt brave.\nHe dove into a faucet wave!\nThen Eli smiled with clothes all wet,\nAnd swam with Mom and his new pets. (3)\n\nThe End"
      seed:
        - "Magic Seed\n\nI found a giant magic seed,\nIts polka dots were pink and green.\nIt said to me, \"Oh pretty please,\"\n\"Will you please plant and water me?\"(1)"
        - "And since the seed was so polite\nI planted him that very night.\nWith dirt I packed him snug and tight,\nIt rained until the morning light. (2)"
        - "When I woke up that magic seed\nHad grown into a big tall tree!\nIts branches had green jelly beans\nAnd bright pink cotton candy leaves! (3)"
        - "100 hungry birds all flew\nTo eat as much as they could chew.\nI asked the tree, \"May I eat too?\"\nIt said, \"Of course! The rest’s for you!\" (4)\n\nThe End"
      chores:
        - "Chores\n\nI love my chores, it's true, it's true!\nI love the things I get to do!\nI get to help take out the trash\nAnd watch the garbage truck go smash! (1)"
        - "I get to help out with the sink\nAnd use the soap to clean (not drink!)\nBut my most favorite chore of all\nIs when I help to paint the walls! (2)\n\nThe End"
